# BloombergChallenge
Presents a UI to customize visualizations of JSON data through charts and graphs

This is my attempt for a challenge presented by Bloomberg.

The goal of this challenge was to parse the given JSON data and create a visualization out of it. 
These visualizations can be any type of chart or graph, but must convey the data in some meaningful way.
